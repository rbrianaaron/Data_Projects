#Background

With sharp decline in oil, I wanted to create a script that would compare the overall drop in royalty trusts to the drop in oil. 

To model the royalty trusts, I did two analysises. The first used four trusts that got the majority of the income from oil and had price data going back to 2010.
All share prices were above five dollars.

The second analysis had 15 trusts who at least one year of data. At the time of the analysis, some shares were under $5.

The funny discovery was how many oil trusts came online around the peak of the oil price.

I also just played around with histograms a bit to see how frequent oil prices in the last five years versus the last 10 years.
